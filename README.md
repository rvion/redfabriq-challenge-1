# RedFabriQ :heart: CASE in Tools 2020

**Context**: e-Citiz is a product by a French company Softeam (DocaPoste brand). e-Citiz is a process automation solution applied in many government organizations in France and abroad. e-Citiz provides digital single-window services such as requests of id documents, school enrolment, voting and etc.

**Goal**: The e-Citiz platform and services are developed in Java in a continuous integration cycle. The previous versions of the platform we integrated with the use of SVN and Jenkins, we are progressively moving to Git (Hosted by Gitlab) and GitLab CI. For the analysis, we would like to evaluate the feasibility and cost to move our Jenkins infrastructure to GitLab CI.

**For the experiment we will intend to provide:**

-   A repository with holes to fill and instructions.

**We expect:**

-   A report on feasibility and cost - supported by an experiment.

The analysis problem may be refined during interviews.
